## Summary

The Marvel Comic Search allows the user to find a collection of comic books for their favorite super hero. All the user has to do is type just a little bit of the hero's name and a plethora of comics are revealed. The user will be given an image of the hero (if there is available) along with a description of the here (again if avaiable). This enables the user to find comics containing their favorite heroes to either beef up their collection, start a collection, or to just browse comics for heroes they might not even now existed! A Marvel nerd's dream in one simple app!
